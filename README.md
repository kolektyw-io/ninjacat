# NinjaCat

Task manager for agile ninjas.

## Why?

Right now, JIRA is cloud only, and it is getting more and more expensive. Also its features are getting lost. Atlassian has also
trying to shift their users from on-premise solution to cloud.

I wanted to create more robust, easier to use, fun and open source tool that would help managers, developers and others
to organise their work.
